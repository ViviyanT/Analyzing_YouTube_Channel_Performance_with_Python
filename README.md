# Analyzing YouTube Channel Performance with Python

## Introduction

In this analysis, we'll explore the performance and engagement metrics of one of my favorite YouTube channels using data collected through the YouTube API. My goal is to demonstrate data retrieval, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization skills using Python. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, key findings, and instructions for exploration.

## Project Overview

**Channel Name:** [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman)

### Project Goals:

- Retrieve channel statistics and video details using the YouTube API.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights about video performance, engagement, and trends.
- Visualize key metrics and trends to better understand the channel's audience and overall performance.

The primary tool used for analysis is a Jupyter Notebook, which contains both code and narrative explanations.

### Data Collection

The data was collected through the YouTube API. The API provided access to channel statistics and video details. The data was cleaned, transformed, and loaded into pandas DataFrames for analysis.

### Key Findings

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- **Video Performance:** Analysis of video view counts, likes, and comments showed interesting trends and correlations.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Insights into the relationship between video duration and engagement metrics.
- **Time Analysis:** Investigation of posting schedule and its impact on viewer engagement.
- **Word Cloud:** Visualization of most common words in video titles.

### Instructions

To explore the analysis and findings, open the `project_notebook.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in this repository. The notebook contains both code and narrative explanations.

### Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and explore the analysis, you'll need the following:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python packages: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, nltk, wordcloud
